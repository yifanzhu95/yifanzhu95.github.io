<p>
For PhD students, please directly apply to our department's CS program, and indicate that you would like to work with me. For current UIC MS or undergraduate students who would like to do research at my lab, please send me an email with the title [MS/Undergrad][YourName], and include your CV, transcripts, and anything else you want to tell me. I will read every email, and reach out to you if there is a good match. Thanks!
